            // Cat.cs
            // Rabbit.cs
            // These classes will have some common attributes: name, age, sexe, but some attributes and methods will be particular:
            // A Person has a method Work(int hours) and display in the console "I work ?? hours each day", and has an an attribute string race "human"
            // A Cat has a method Purr(bool isBeingPet) that display in the console "Rrrrr" if the boolean is set to true, else "Where is my hooman?", and has an an attribute string race "cat"
            // A Rabbit has a method Binkies(double happiness) that display in the console "I'm so happy I'm doing some binkies" is the happiness is greater that 90%,
            // or "Give me some food and pet me!" otherwise, and has an an attribute string race "bunbun"

            // When these objects are instantiated, it should be displayed in the console who they are (name, age, sexe and race!)
            // Then, when you call their specific method, they will perform it

            // Create a person object
            /* Your code here */

            // Create a cat object
            /* Your code here */

            // Create two different rabbit objects
            /* Your code here */
